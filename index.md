# Tracey's Blog

Hey, my name is Tracey Ordo√±ez, I am a student at the [Brooklyn STEAM Center](https://brooklynsteamcenter.org/) and am currently studying Full-Stack Development.

In this blog I will be giving updates on any current projects I am working on as well as any issues I face and how I resolved them.
