# Unpacking the School Experience

Many when describing their highschool years or when asked about the highschool experience in general may describe it as the best years of your life and to enjoy it while you can and as of now I can safely say that so far overall, perhaps it is. Afterall most of my more impactful decisions and experiences have happened over these past 3 years of being in highschool. As a senior this year I've had time to reflect on all my highschool experiences and I've realized most of my decisions whether well thought out or not have had a significant impact on where I am at in life and that is both an uneasy yet comforting thought.

I first came into highschool with no real expectations. I wanted to come in with a blank slate and take it as it was so I didn't bother to ask other people how their experience was and I'm glad i didnt highschool is very conflicting.
