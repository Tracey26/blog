# Unpacking the School Experience

Many when describing their highschool years or when asked about the highschool experience in general may describe it as the best years of your life and to enjoy it while you can and as of now I can safely say that so far overall, perhaps it is. Afterall most of my more impactful decisions and experiences have happened over these past 3 years of being in highschool. As a senior this year I've had time to reflect on all my highschool experiences and I've realized most of my decisions whether well thought out or not have had a significant impact on where I am at in life and that is both an uneasy yet comforting thought.

I first came into highschool with no real expectations. I wanted to come in with a blank slate and take it as it was so I didn't bother to ask other people how their experience was and I'm glad I didn't since highschool is very conflicting, youll go through what seems the worst of times when you have a mountain of homework you put off to end and now you have one day to complete it all or even tests you may have studied for and still don't feel ready. However all of this balances out somehow with the people you meet, trips you may go on and opportunities you receive to further yourself, at least in my case.

Freshman year was probably the most calm year in terms of workload and stress it made for the overall transition of middle school to high school easier since we had just come out of remote learning, however with the fear that covid would rise up again all the work mostly became online and that has now continued for the rest of my highschool experience.
